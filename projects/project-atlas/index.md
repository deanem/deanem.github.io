## Problem

Research notes were spread across files and tools, making recall slow and inconsistent.

## Approach

- Indexed notes into a searchable document store.
- Added relevance scoring and metadata filters.
- Designed a simple UI for quick lookup and context previews.

## Outcome

- Initial benchmark target: reduce retrieval time to under 20 seconds.
- Next step: publish production telemetry after broader use.
