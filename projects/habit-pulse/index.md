## Problem

Most habit apps optimize for streak pressure, not realistic weekly follow-through.

## Approach

- Built weekly check-ins and lightweight progress summaries.
- Added nudges tuned to missed patterns instead of daily guilt loops.
- Focused on low-friction interactions for repeat use.

## Outcome

- Launch milestone target: 55%+ four-week retention.
- Next step: validate retention and nudge effectiveness with live cohorts.
