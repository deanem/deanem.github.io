## Problem

Draft notes are often useful but hard to share without time-consuming cleanup.

## Approach

- Built a browser extension with one-click rewrite actions.
- Added style presets for concise, formal, and friendly outputs.
- Optimized for short turnaround directly in the writing flow.

## Outcome

- Prototype goal: reduce note rewrite time by at least 50%.
- Next step: collect session-level timing data from pilot users.
