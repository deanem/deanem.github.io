Hi, I’m **Deane McCullough**. I build digital products with a bias for clarity, speed, and maintainability.

My background blends engineering and product thinking. I enjoy taking fuzzy ideas, breaking them into useful slices, and shipping them with measurable impact.

## What I focus on

- Crafting software that feels simple to use and straightforward to maintain.
- Building systems that are resilient and observable in production.
- Writing documentation and posts that help others move faster.

## Outside of work

When I’m not coding, I’m usually reading, lifting, or experimenting with new workflows that reduce noise and save time.
