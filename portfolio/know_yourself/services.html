<h1>Other Services</h1>

<p>As a company Identity Exploration provides a wide range of services and more in depth tools than those found here on Know Yourself.  The Ipseus software has had various uses in the workplace, community and at academic levels for which we can provide.</p>

<h5>Workplace</h5>

<p>Our individual assessments provide unique insights that go much wider than personality. They can help our customers with in-depth looks at all parts of themselves. The Individual Assessments such as 'Ideal Match' measures candidate fit with a defined role while 'Ideal Match+' provides a deeper analysis of the individual.</p>

<p>We have a highly flexible 360<sup>o</sup> feedback competency based tool compares self-perceptions with feedback from colleagues, describing the gaps between aspired and actual behaviours.</p>

<p>Our 360° feedback tool is like no other. Our unique focus on both existing and aspirational behaviours provides a great platform to assess gaps from multiple perspectives.</p>

<p>Culture check allows us to identify core values, compare and contrast different parts of your organisation, evaluate leaders and set priorities for change.</p>

<p class="quote">"We are open to innovative partnering models where both parties share the investment and the reward!"</p>

<p>We have an experienced team of psychologists, statisticians and developers who can build bespoke tools for special projects on a timely and cost effective basis.</p>

<p>Our workplace product range will provide you with a powerful suite of assessments that will give you an immediate competitive edge. No other products are built on the ISA platform so you can be sure you will have something very unique.</p>

<p>We have a growing network of specialised partners with whom we are highly connected. As well as providing lower cost access to our standard instruments, we are increasingly collaborating in the development of bespoke instruments for use with specific clients to tackle specific issues.</p>


<h5>Community</h5>

<p>Personal and group identity issues lie at the centre of many of the problems seen in our communities.  Identity Exploration provides a range of services to organisations working to build greater community cohesion.</p>

<h5>Academia</h5>

<p>The arena of original academic research ranges from projects for University postgraduate degrees at the MSc and PhD levels to collaborative research by established University academics.</p>

<p>Research projects of the kind spearheaded by University researchers use the Identity Structure Analysis (ISA) conceptualisation of identity processes for undergraduate final year projects, postgraduate MSc and PhD dissertations, and collaborative projects by professional academic staff. Individual case study analyses of people's identifications with various agents and institutions may be assessed cross-culturally with identity instruments customised in the language of the participants, taking into account differing value and belief systems. Standardisation procedures enable comparisons to be made across groups and individuals using differing customisations. For practical investigations ISA is facilitated by the Ipseus software.</p>
