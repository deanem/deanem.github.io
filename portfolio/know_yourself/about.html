<h1>About Us</h1>



<h5>Who we are</h5>

<p>Know Yourself through Identity Exploration is a company that provides leading edge identity analysis tools for anyone who is interested in exploring any aspect of themselves.</p>

<p class="quote">"Only company in the world working with Identity Structure Analysis."</p>

<p>As a company, Know Yourself through Identity Explortion is founded on the Meta psychological framework of Identity Structure Analysis (ISA). Identity Structure Analysis was developed 30 years ago and has some truly unique mechanisms for identifying and presenting profound insights into the underlying identity processes of individuals or groups.</p>

<p>Identity Exploration is the only company in the world working with Identity Structure Analysis, and so is in a unique position to offer this conceptual tool to our customers and partners through Know Yourself. We achieve this by means of our robust technology in the form of our software package, Ipseus. Ipseus is our core technology; it underlies everything we do and is a powerful aid to psychological analysis.</p>


<h5>What we can offer</h5>

<p>We can provide our specialist Ipseus software to researchers and analysts who want to build investigative tools to explore particular issues surrounding identity. But not only researchers and analysts can gain benefits from this unique software, anyone can!</p>

<p>We can offer help, guidance and training in the building of an instrument and expert help and support in a follow up capacity.</p>

<p>In house, using your specifications, we can use our specialist software and expert knowledge to design and build a bespoke identity instrument for you.</p>

<p>This software allows anyone to explore any aspect of themselves such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>What they like and dislike</li>
		<li>Causes of grief or pleasure</li>
		<li>Their values, beliefs and feelings</li>
		<li>Relationships with others</li>
	</ul>

<p>You can then put your ideas about yourself and others into the Ipseus software and have them produce a report that helps them make more sense of their unique complex selves. </p>

<p>If you require a means to explore identity, we can provide it.</p>
