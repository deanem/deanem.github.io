Starting from scratch can be overwhelming, so I default to a short checklist:

1. Clarify the outcome in one sentence.
2. Build the smallest path to value.
3. Add lightweight observability early.
4. Write down assumptions and open risks.
5. Ship, measure, and adjust fast.

The goal is not perfect planning. The goal is momentum with enough structure to avoid rework.
