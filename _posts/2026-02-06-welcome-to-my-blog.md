description: Why I'm writing here and what you can expect.

This blog is where I document what I build and what I learn along the way.

You can expect posts about:

- Shipping software with less ceremony.
- Practical tooling choices and tradeoffs.
- Lessons from projects that worked, and projects that didn't.

Thanks for reading. More soon.
